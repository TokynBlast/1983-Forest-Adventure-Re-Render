# 1983-Forest-Adventure-Re-Render
A re-rendering of the classic game, Forest Adventure

I had trouble finding much on the game, and the only help I had was that it came on the Merkury 200-in-1..<br>
Which I like it, but it needs to fix the duplicate games, and should be called a 136-in-1<br>
The battery sucks a little bit too, and doesn't charge in 2.5 hours, like it says it does.<br>
Other than that, It is a really cool system!<br>

The assets were made in Paint<br>
The code was made in IDLE

From what I can find, the only place that MIGHT have made it was 90s Studios,<br>
but I can't find anything on them either.

Any help with finsing more info on the game is super useful!<br>
